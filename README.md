# Local Proxy

This simple docker setup allows you to redirect a locally configured domain to your localhost, pointing to a specific port number.

Specifically, this is currently used for forwarding:

```
nle.local.styla.eu 
```

to

```
localhost:7008
```

---
**NOTE**

The redirect is currently hardcoded in the `httpd.conf` file (look for `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse`). If you need a different redirect, just edit the file accordingly.

---
